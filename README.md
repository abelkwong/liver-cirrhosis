# Liver Cirrhosis Prediction using Random Forest

This project uses a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest to predict liver cirrhosis in patients. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the [Indian Liver Patient Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset)) from the UCI ML Repository. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later

- Jupyter Notebook

- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and pycaret

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook by running jupyter notebook in your terminal:
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the `liver cirrhosis prediction using random forest.ipynb` file in your browser and run the code.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook contains step-by-step instructions on how to train and test the Random Forest model. You can also modify the code to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques.
